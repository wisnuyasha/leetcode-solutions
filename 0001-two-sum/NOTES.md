## Analysis

My first approach is to use brute force with nested loops, checking if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the target and returning their indices. This is not an ideal solution because the time complexity is O(NÂ²).

### Solution 1 : Brute Force
```js
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
  let output: number[] = [];

  nums.map((num, idx) => {
    if (output.length !== 0) return;
    nums.map((n, i) => {
        if (i !== idx && num + n === target) {
        output.push(idx, i);
        return;
      }
    });
  });

  return output;
}
```

I realized that it can be done with a more effective approach. So i used the hashmap (object in JS) to store the `x` of `target - y` with the index (`i`), `y` is the current iteration number (`nums[i]`). This approach has a time complexity of O(N) because it requires only a single loop

### Solution 2 : Hashmap
```js
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    const h: { [key: number]: number } = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const c = target - nums[i];
        if (c in h) {
            return [h[c], i];
        }
        h[nums[i]] = i;
    }
    return [];
}
```
